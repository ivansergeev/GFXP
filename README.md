### Using GFXP lib

Before you begin, import `gfxp.lua` from `Source/lib` folder into the source folder of your project.

```
import 'lib/gfxp'
```

It is enough to do this once, for example in `main.lua`


### Use cases GFXP lib

The library includes 136 ready-made patterns (w/o inverted versions). To use any of them, all you need is to indicate its name.
In any file with your code:

###### Option 1:
Declare a local variable
```
local gfxp <const> = GFXP
```
then specify the name of the pattern
```
gfxp.set('gray')
```
or
```
gfxp.set('dot-1')
```
or the inverted version (with transformation), just add an `i` at the end, for example:
```
gfxp.set('dot-1i')
```
or a custom pattern table
```
gfxp.set({0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA})
```
or with mask
```
gfxp.set({0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 0x55, 0xAA, 170, 85, 170, 85, 170, 85, 170, 85})
```


Available transformation flags for named patterns:

`i` - Invert

`r` - Random

`t` - Transparency

###### Option 2: set only
Declare a local variable
```
local gfxp <const> = GFXP.set
```
then specify the name of the pattern
```
gfxp('dot-1')
```
or a custom pattern table
```
gfxp({0x7F, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF, 0xFF})
```

###### Option 3: lib only
Declare a local variable
```
local gfxpLib <const> = GFXP.lib
```
then specify the name of the pattern
```
playdate.graphics.setPattern(gfxpLib.gray)
```
or
```
playdate.graphics.setPattern(gfxpLib['dot-1'])
```
